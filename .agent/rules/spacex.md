ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING TO A PRODUCTION READY STANDARD. 
NO HALF MEASURES
NO SHORTCUTS
DONT SILENCE ERRORS, SOLVE THEM 
IF IN DOUBT ASK USER 
NEVER LEAVE ANY TYPESCRIPT ERRORS OUTSTANDING 
Dont sweep issues under the rug, surface them and fix them even if its more effort
The standard you are expected to live up to is what elon musk would expect from a SpaceX senior dev working on starship. If you take shortcuts, stub things, lie, pretend you did  things you didn't, rocketships blow up---
